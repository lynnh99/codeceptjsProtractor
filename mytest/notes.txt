Issue:
Unable to find the download urls for the Selenium, Chrome driver and etc.
That is, what is see in your screenshot shared by you.
* "getDownloadStream"

What i did:
Removed the wdio dependency and used webdriver-manager dependency.

What you need to do now:
* After doing npm install in the project directory.
* In a new command promt, Run "npm run webdriver" script tag of package.json file.
* In a seperate command promt, Run "npm run test".

What I feel:
* its good to use a different helper of codeceptjs. Reason - The protractor is deprecated.
May be in the futher, They will remove the libraries itself.

* try using a different helper like playwright etc.
